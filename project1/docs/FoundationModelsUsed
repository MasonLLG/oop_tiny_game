We acknowledge the use of AI in this assessment.
AI was used to get a general idea of how some of the parts of the engine can be used in the game, through Copilot/ChatGPT.
AI was also used to do some auto-completions when commenting the code.
The specific models used were GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and GPT-4o-mini-high.
