## **Requirement 3: The Oracle**
_A really cool idea that we'd love to see is the use of an API (not limited to LLM API). For example:
A new NPC that monologues using an LLM API (make sure that you include more functionalities to adhere to the rule no. 4 above)_

Story:

Within the valley, there exists enigmatic figure known as the Oracle (represented by 'O') that the NPC can interact with to have some very interesting monolouges.

Once every 3 turns, if the farmer is within two tiles of the Oracle, it will produce a cryptic monolouge that calls out to an external LLM API. Based on the mode of the monolouge, the contents may change.

1.	
    Prophecy Mode: The Oracle predicts the Farmer’s near future.
2. 
	Riddle Mode: The Oracle poses a puzzle for the Farmer to ponder.
3. 
	Compliment Mode: The Oracle offers encouraging words.

The Oracle itself never moves or attacks—it merely stands sentinel.

Additionally, if the Farmer carries the Sacred Scroll item ('S') and uses it on The Oracle, this should prompt the LLM to answer a specific question (“Help me find my next seed,” etc.). This direct “ask” can be used any number of times, but costs 25 stamina per question.


## **Requirement 4: Tending the Land**
_Realistic farming system. For instance, plants need to be watered, grounds can be shovelled, etc._

Within the valley, the blight has meant the land has lost its fertility and requires care to work towards its restoration. The farmer can help restore life to the land through the careful tending of the soil and nurturing of plants.

Any cursed soil, including the blight, can be tended to by the farmer, which will cost them 20 stamina points.

Once a seed takes root on healthy soil, it must be kept alive by frequent watering. The Inheritree must be watered every 5 turns, while the Bloodrose must be watered every 7 turns, in order to keep it alive. If the plants die due to dehydration, they will leave behind withered soil that cannot support new life.

A farmer can purchase a watering can from the shopkeeper for 50 coins, which will allow them to water plants. The watering can has a capacity of 5 uses, after which it must be refilled at the shopkeeper for 10 coins.
The farmer may also purchase an automatic watering system from the shopkeeper for 200 coins, which may be placed near a plant to automatically water it every 5 turns. The automatic watering system has a capacity of 10 uses, after which it must be refilled at the shopkeeper for 20 coins.

The Inheritree can be harvested after 10 turns of growth, yielding 1 Inheritree Fruit, which can be sold for 100 coins. It may also be used to restore 50 stamina points when consumed.
Other plants may be able to be harvested in the future.
